### Hi there, I'm आर्या पाटील 👋

I'm a PhD candidate in Astronomy & Astrophysics 🔭 at the University of Toronto. I perform large-scale Data Driven studies to understand how the Milky Way formed and evolved 🌌. Prior to this, I earned a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering 💻 and entered the exciting world of open source software development through Google Summer of Code 2017. I am a lover of stars, coding, statistics and open science.
