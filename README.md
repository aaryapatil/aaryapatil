### Hi there, I'm आर्या पाटील 👋

I am a PhD candidate in Astronomy & Astrophysics and Data Sciences Institute Doctoral Student Fellow at the University of Toronto 🔭 I perform large-scale data-driven studies to understand how the Milky Way galaxy formed and evolved 🌌 Prior to this, I earned a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering and entered the exciting world of open-source software development through Google Summer of Code 2017. I am now a finance committee and voting member of Astropy, and have mentored a Google Summer of Code 2021 project under the OpenAstronomy organization 🌕
