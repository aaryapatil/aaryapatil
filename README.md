### Hi there, I'm आर्या पाटील 👋

I am an LSST Discovery Alliance Catalyst Fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy. I perform large-scale data-driven studies to understand how the Milky Way galaxy formed and evolved 🌌 Prior to this, I obtained a PhD in Astronomy & Astrophysics and Data Sciences Institute Doctoral Student Fellow at the University of Toronto 🔭. I first entered the exciting world of open-source software development during my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering through the Google Summer of Code 2017 program. I am now a finance committee and voting member of the AstroPy project, and have mentored a Google Summer of Code 2021 project under the OpenAstronomy organization 🌕
