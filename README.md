### Hi there, I'm आर्या पाटील 👋

I am a PhD candidate in Astronomy & Astrophysics at the University of Toronto 🔭 .
I perform large-scale Data Driven studies to understand how the Milky Way formed and evolved 🌌 .
Prior to this, I earned a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering and entered the exciting world of open source software development through Google Summer of Code 2017, where I worked as a student developer for Astropy. I am now a voting member of Astropy and have mentored a Google Summer of Code 2021 project under the OpenAstronomy organization 💻 .
