### Hi there, I'm आर्या पाटील 👋

I am an LSST Discovery Alliance Catalyst Fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy. I perform large-scale data-driven studies to understand how the Milky Way galaxy formed and evolved 🌌 Prior to this, I obtained a PhD in Astronomy & Astrophysics at the University of Toronto (UofT). I was awarded a Data Sciences Institute Doctoral Student Fellowship at UofT for my cross-disciplinary work 🔭. I first entered the exciting world of open-source software development during my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering through the Google Summer of Code 2017 program. I am now a finance committee and voting member of the Astropy project, and have mentored a Google Summer of Code 2021 project under the OpenAstronomy organization 🌕 I am also passionate about science education and outreach, and have organised several data science in astronomy schools as part of the [Astropy training school](https://astro.bas.bg/astropy2023/) and the [Pan-African School for Emerging Astronomers](https://www.paseaafrica.org/home) teams.
